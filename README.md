# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts survival on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. It analyzes passenger data and predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Overview

The Titanic survival prediction model is built using Python and utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. It explores factors such as passenger class, age, gender, and fare to predict survival probabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It contains the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID assigned to each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Passenger's gender
- **Age**: Passenger's age
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. **Explore the dataset:**

   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment to open and explore the `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
   - Review the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering techniques used.

3. **Train the model:**

   - Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train the machine learning model.
   - Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines can be tested and evaluated.

4. **Evaluate and predict:**

   - Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or ROC AUC score.
   - Predict survival probabilities for new data or validate predictions against the test dataset.

5. **Experiment and improve:**

   - Experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature selections to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Visualize results using Matplotlib or other visualization libraries to gain insights into model performance.
